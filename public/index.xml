      <description>I have been strugling with Kafka recently, or at least log4j. The default configuration output a lot of logs to stdout. In my actual configuration, stdout logs from an application are captured by systemd-journald and then given to rsyslog. This can come handy when the application doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to log with syslog. However, I had an issue with Kafka and journald where logs were also written to the filesystem until the partition is full.</description>
