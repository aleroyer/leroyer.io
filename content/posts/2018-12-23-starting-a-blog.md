So it begins.

I'm starting a blog and I will try to write some posts related to tech stuff.

Most of my posts will be about opensource stuff related to infrastructure and linux systems.

I hope that you will enjoy reading my posts!

In the mean time you can check links in the sidebar and come back here in a few months :)
