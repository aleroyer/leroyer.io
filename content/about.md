In IT for at least 10 years, I'm a passionate engineer that can be quickly interested in anything.

Typical geek/nerd: I like IT, video games, music, mangas and animes.

## Career summary

I started working as an apprentice at Netvibes in 2013 as a System Administrator. I made a short hop into a big company (EDF) as a Developper from 2013 to 2016, still as an apprentice.
